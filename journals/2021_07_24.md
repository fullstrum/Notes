- #businessIdea App to allow folks/churches/businesses in the city "rent" a parking space when it's not being used. 
	 - Not reasonable for enforcement

	 - Allow unused parking to not be wasted. For example, a church could rent spots through the week.

	 - App would show users where the spots are, and then collect the fee.

- #businessIdea Payment (gift card?) processor for farmers markets/flee markets/etc.
	 - Allow a user to buy a gift card to Lancaster Market, use it at any vendor

	 - Possibly make a storefront for all the companies inside the market as well?

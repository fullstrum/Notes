- [[spiritual disciplines]] [[Redemptive Lamenting]] [[Sacred Wrestling]]
	 - 1 - Take notice of scripture that does not resonate with your current circumstances, and that may feel untrue. Choose to honor your feelings of conflict. Schedule a time to be alone with God and the Bible to practice Sacred Wrestling.

	 - 2 - Choose a [[Psalm]] of Lament that best describes your feelings toward God. Some examples are Psalm 10, 13, 22, 44, 88 & 89. Use this as your opening prayer. Open to the portion of scripture that causes conflict within you. Read it slowly and prayerfully.

	 - 3 - In the spririt of the lamenting Psalms, cry out to God about the circumstances of your life that are a contrast to the verses in question. Consider using your physical body for this complaint. Examples include pacing, yelling, crying, wringing hands, and more.

	 - 4 - After meditating on conflicting scripture again as well as your own lament, enter a time of surrender. This is a time where you may be silent before God. It may also be helpful to prayerfully repeat scripture such as "not my will but yours be done" or "Your ways are not my ways, Your thoughts are not my thoughts." You can also repeat a helpful prayerful phrase such as "You are God, I am not" or "I surrender." What matters most is consciously embracing a posture of surrender. Laying prostrate can be particularly meaningful for this time. 

	 - 5 - Repeat the former steps until there is a sense of true surrender and in which you have exchanged your truth for God's truth. End with a recognition of God's goodness, if you are able.
